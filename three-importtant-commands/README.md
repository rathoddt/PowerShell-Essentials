Three commands that I consider to be the building blocks of learning to
use PowerShell on a daily basis. 
1. Get help.
`Get-Help`
This cmdlet helps you get information to how to use a cmdlet. 

2. Get-command
`Get-command`   
This is the command that you would use to get only the commands that are
currently imported into PowerShell.

3. Get-Service
`Get-Service`  
This cmdlet helps you get the objects that represent the started and stop
services on the computer. You're currently logged into.
